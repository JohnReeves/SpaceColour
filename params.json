{"name":"Spacecolour","tagline":"Colour your solar system with Material Design.","body":"#Space Worksheet 1.5\r\n\r\n![alt text](http://imgur.com/fEOkc2K.png \"space example\")\r\n\r\nYou need to find the JSFiddle link for the solar system that you made last week - if for whatever reason you can't or you have lost it I have made you a [starting jsfiddle](http://jsfiddle.net/Y662q/) - you will need to fork it before you start!\r\n\r\n##Task 1 - Hex Colours\r\n\r\nThere are many ways to represent colours with computers - we've been telling our svg shapes to be \"red\" or \"yellow\" or \"green\" - this isn't great if you want a specific colour green!\r\n\r\n###Option A - rgb values\r\n\r\nMicrosoft Word likes to use this - if you ever try to change the colour to a custom colour you get a colour wheel:\r\n![alt text](http://www.codeproject.com/KB/miscctrl/XColorSpectrumCtrl/XColorSpectrumCtrl4.png \"microsoft word colour picker\")\r\n\r\nThis gets you three values (Red, Green, Blue) - 0 means you've got none of that colour, 255 means a lot of that colour. So:\r\n* red would be 255,0,0\r\n* green would be 0,255,0\r\n* purple would be 153,51,204\r\n\r\n###Option B - Hex Values\r\n\r\n*this is what most people use now*\r\n\r\nBasically a more efficient way of representing a rgb value - Instead of going from 0 to 255, you go from 00 to FF\r\n* red would be #FF0000\r\n* green is #00FF00\r\n* purple would be #9933CC\r\n\r\nTry making each of your planets a more accurate colour in your solar system. There are some links at the bottom of the page to get some hex color codes quickly!\r\n\r\n##Task 2 - Gradients\r\n\r\n###Linear gradients\r\n\r\n![alt text](http://imgur.com/bcMc4tX.png \"linear gradient\")\r\n\r\n```xml\r\n  <linearGradient id=\"grad1\" x1=\"0%\" y1=\"0%\" x2=\"100%\" y2=\"0%\">\r\n      <stop offset=\"0%\" stop-color=\"#1AD6FD\"/>\r\n      <stop offset=\"100%\" stop-color=\"#1D62F0\" />\r\n  </linearGradient>\r\n    \r\n  <circle cx=\"100\" cy=\"100\" r=\"100\" fill=\"url(#grad1)\" />\r\n```\r\n* id = the name of the gradient - needed to give to the circle's fill attribute\r\n* x1 & x2 = start and stop x values = these go from 0 to 100 to make our gradient\r\n* y1 & y2 = start and stop y values = these stay constant for our example\r\n* stop offset\r\n  * offest = how far down the gradient you want the colour\r\n  * stop-color = hex code for the stop point\r\n\r\n###Radial Gradients\r\n\r\n![alt text](http://imgur.com/D0j6wqk.png \"radial gradient\")\r\n\r\n```xml\r\n  <radialGradient id=\"grad2\" cx=\"50%\" cy=\"50%\" r=\"50%\" fx=\"50%\" fy=\"50%\">\r\n      <stop offset=\"0%\" stop-color=\"#ffcc00\" />\r\n      <stop offset=\"100%\" stop-color=\"#cc0000\" />\r\n  </radialGradient>\r\n  \r\n  <circle cx=\"100\" cy=\"100\" r=\"100\" fill=\"url(#grad2)\" />\r\n```\r\n* id = used to connect with the shapes you want that colour\r\n* cx & cy = represent the center coordinates for the outer circle\r\n* r = how far the gradient should go out from the center\r\n* fx & fy = denote the coordinates for the inner circle\r\n\r\nIn your solar system - make Earth use a horizontal linear gradient from green to blue. If you get time make your sun become a radial gradient.\r\n\r\n##Useful Colour Links\r\n\r\n1. http://www.colorhexa.com\r\n2. http://ios7colors.com/\r\n3. http://developer.android.com/design/style/color.html","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
